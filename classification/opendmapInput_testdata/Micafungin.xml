DDI-DrugBank.d735.s0 >> A total of 11 clinical drug-drug interaction studies were conducted in healthy volunteers to evaluate the potential for interaction between MYCAMINE and mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, prednisolone, sirolimus, nifedipine, fluconazole, ritonavir, and rifampin. >> 140-147,153-173,176-187,190-199,202-213,216-224,227-236,239-249,252-260,267-274
DDI-DrugBank.d735.s1 >> In these studies, no interaction that altered the pharmacokinetics of micafungin was observed. >> 70-79
DDI-DrugBank.d735.s2 >> There was no effect of a single dose or multiple doses of MYCAMINE on mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, prednisolone, and fluconazole pharmacokinetics. >> 58-65,70-90,93-104,107-116,119-130,137-147
DDI-DrugBank.d735.s3 >> Sirolimus AUC was increased by 21% with no effect on Cmax in the presence of steady-state MYCAMINE compared with sirolimus alone. >> 0-8,90-97,113-121
DDI-DrugBank.d735.s4 >> Nifedipine AUC and Cmax were increased by 18% and 42%, respectively, in the presence of steady-state MYCAMINE compared with nifedipine alone. >> 0-9,101-108,124-133
DDI-DrugBank.d735.s5 >> Patients receiving sirolimus or nifedipine in combination with MYCAMINE should be monitored for sirolimus or nifedipine toxicity and sirolimus or nifedipine dosage should be reduced if necessary. >> 19-27,32-41,63-70,96-104,109-118,133-141,146-155
DDI-DrugBank.d735.s6 >> Micafungin is not an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and, therefore, would not be expected to alter P-glycoprotein-mediated drug transport activity. >> 0-9
