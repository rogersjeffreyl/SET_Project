DDI-DrugBank.d762.s0 >> Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion and thus inhibits the renal excretion of meropenem. >> 0-9,25-33,105-113
DDI-DrugBank.d762.s1 >> This led to statistically significant increases in the elimination half-life (38%) and in the extent of systemic exposure (56%).
DDI-DrugBank.d762.s2 >> Therefore, the coadministration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended. >> 35-44,51-59
DDI-DrugBank.d762.s3 >> There is evidence that meropenem may reduce serum levels of valproic acid to subtherapeutic levels (therapeutic range considered to be 50 to 100    g/mL total valproate). >> 23-31,60-72,159-167
