DDI-DrugBank.d641.s0 >> ALIMTA is primarily eliminated unchanged renally as a result of glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. >> 0-5
DDI-DrugBank.d641.s1 >> Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic drugs could result in delayed clearance of ALIMTA. >> 85-90
DDI-DrugBank.d641.s2 >> Concomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted (e.g., probenecid) could potentially result in delayed clearance of ALIMTA. >> 81-90,142-147
DDI-DrugBank.d641.s3 >> Although ibuprofen (400 mg qid) can be administered with ALIMTA in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance    80 mL/min), caution should be used when administering ibuprofen concurrently with ALIMTA to patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 mL/min). >> 9-17,57-62,182-190,210-215
DDI-DrugBank.d641.s4 >> Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency should avoid taking NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives for a period of 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of ALIMTA. >> 71-76,194-199
DDI-DrugBank.d641.s5 >> In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between ALIMTA and NSAIDs with longer half-lives, all patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least 5 days before, the day of, and 2 days following ALIMTA administration. >> 63-68,74-79,131-136,223-228
DDI-DrugBank.d641.s6 >> If concomitant administration of an NSAID is necessary, patients should be monitored closely for toxicity, especially myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity. >> 36-40
DDI-DrugBank.d641.s7 >> Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions None known.
