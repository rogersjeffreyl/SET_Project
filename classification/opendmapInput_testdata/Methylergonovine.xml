DDI-DrugBank.d675.s0 >> CYP 3A4 Inhibitors (e.g. Macrolide Antibiotics and Protease Inhibitors) There have been rare reports of serious adverse events in connection with the coadministration of certain ergot alkaloid drugs (e.g. dihydroergotamine and ergotamine) and potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors, resulting in vasospasm leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. >> 25-45,51-69,178-197,205-221,227-236
DDI-DrugBank.d675.s1 >> Although there have been no reports of such interactions with methylergonovine alone, potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors should not be coadministered with methylergonovine. >> 62-77
DDI-DrugBank.d675.s2 >> Examples of some of the more potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors include macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, troleandomycin, clarithromycin), HIV protease or reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, delavirdine) or azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole). >> 63-83,92-103,106-119,122-135,139-150;177-186,155-186,195-203,206-214,217-226,229-239,245-261,270-281,284-295,298-309
DDI-DrugBank.d675.s3 >> Less potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors should be administered with caution.
DDI-DrugBank.d675.s4 >> Less potent inhibitors include saquinavir, nefazodone, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, zileuton, and clotrimazole. >> 31-40,43-52,55-65,86-95,98-108,111-118,125-136

DDI-DrugBank.d675.s6 >> No pharmacokinetic interactions involving other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are known.
DDI-DrugBank.d675.s7 >> Caution should be exercised when Methergine    (methylergonovine maleate) is used concurrently with other vasoconstrictors or ergot alkaloids. >> 33-42,48-71,106-121,126-140
