DDI-DrugBank.d709.s0 >> Concomitant administration contra-indicated:  - Vasoconstrictive ergot alkaloids. >> 65-79
DDI-DrugBank.d709.s1 >> Concomitant administrations not recommended:  - Terfenadine and astemizole: Certain macrolides interact with terfenadine and astemizole leading to increased serum concentrations of the latter. >> 48-58,64-73,84-93,109-119,125-134
DDI-DrugBank.d709.s2 >> This may result in severe ventricular arrhythmia, typically torsades de pointe.
DDI-DrugBank.d709.s3 >> Although such a reaction has not been demonstrated with roxithromycin, concomitant administration of roxithromycin with terfenadine or astemizole is not recommended. >> 56-68,101-113,120-130,135-144
DDI-DrugBank.d709.s4 >> - Cisapride, pimozide: Other drugs such as cisapride or pimozide, which are metabolised by hepatic CYP3A isozymes have been associated with QT interval prolongation and/or cardiac arrythmias (typically torsades de pointe) as a result of increase in their serum level subsequent to interaction with significant inhibitors of the isozyme, including some macrolide antibacterials. >> 2-10,13-20,43-51,56-63,352-375
DDI-DrugBank.d709.s5 >> Although such a risk is not verified for roxithromycin, combination of roxithromycin with such drugs is not recommended. >> 41-53,71-83
