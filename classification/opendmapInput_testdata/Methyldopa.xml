DDI-DrugBank.d779.s0 >> When methyldopa is used with other antihypertensive drugs, potentiation of antihypertensive effect may occur. >> 5-14,35-56
DDI-DrugBank.d779.s1 >> Patients should be followed carefully to detect side reactions or unusual manifestations of drug idiosyncrasy.
DDI-DrugBank.d779.s2 >> Patients may require reduced doses of anesthetics when on methyldopa. >> 38-48,58-67
DDI-DrugBank.d779.s3 >> If hypotension does occur during anesthesia, it usually can be controlled by vasopressors. >> 77-88
DDI-DrugBank.d779.s4 >> The adrenergic receptors remain sensitive during treatment with methyldopa. >> 64-73
DDI-DrugBank.d779.s5 >> When methyldopa and lithium are given concomitantly the patient should be carefully monitored for symptoms of lithium toxicity. >> 5-14,20-26,110-116
DDI-DrugBank.d779.s6 >> Read the circular for lithium preparations. >> 22-28
DDI-DrugBank.d779.s7 >> Several studies demonstrate a decrease in the bioavailability of methyldopa when it is ingested with ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate. >> 65-74,101-115,120-136
DDI-DrugBank.d779.s8 >> This may adversely affect blood pressure control in patients treated with methyldopa. >> 74-83
DDI-DrugBank.d779.s9 >> Coadministration of methyldopa with ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate is not recommended. >> 20-29,36-50,55-71
DDI-DrugBank.d779.s10 >> Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors: See CONTRAINDICATIONS. >> 0-33
DDI-DrugBank.d779.s11 >> Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Methyldopa may interfere with measurement of: urinary uric acid by the phosphotungstate method, serum creatinine by the alkaline picrate method, and SGOT by colorimetric methods. >> 34-43
DDI-DrugBank.d779.s12 >> Interference with spectrophotometric methods for SGOT analysis has not been reported.
DDI-DrugBank.d779.s13 >> Since methyldopa causes fluorescence in urine samples at the same wave lengths as catecholamines, falsely high levels of urinary catecholamines may be reported. >> 6-15
DDI-DrugBank.d779.s14 >> This will interfere with the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.
DDI-DrugBank.d779.s15 >> It is important to recognize this phenomenon before a patient with a possible pheochromocytoma is subjected to surgery.
DDI-DrugBank.d779.s16 >> Methyldopa does not interfere with measurement of VMA (vanillylmandelic acid), a test for pheochromocytoma, by those methods which convert VMA to vanillin. >> 0-9,50-52,55-75,139-141,146-153

DDI-DrugBank.d779.s18 >> Rarely, when urine is exposed to air after voiding, it may darken because of breakdown of methyldopa or its metabolites. >> 90-99
