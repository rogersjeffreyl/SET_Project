DDI-DrugBank.d645.s0 >> In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, and cyclosporine. >> 57-67,104-114,117-132,135-148,155-166
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s1 >> In vitro studies have also shown that terbinafine inhibits CYP2D6-mediated metabolism. >> 38-48
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s2 >> This may be of clinical relevance for compounds predominantly metabolized by this enzyme, such as tricyclic antidepressants,    -blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-Is) Type B, if they have a narrow therapeutic window. >> 98-122,139-177,180-184,192-235
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s3 >> In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in normal volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. >> 89-99,134-143,148-154
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s4 >> Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. >> 0-10,39-46

DDI-DrugBank.d645.s6 >> There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between LAMISIL    Tablets and these changes has not been established. >> 119-129,135-142,184-190
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s7 >> Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CyP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CyP450 enzyme inhibitor. >> 0-10,43-50,99-108
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s8 >> Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. >> 0-10,39-50
DDI-DrugBank.d645.s9 >> There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, theophyllines, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. >> 120-133,167-179,182-194,197-206,209-226,229-241,248-271
