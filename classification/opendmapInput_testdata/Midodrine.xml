DDI-DrugBank.d603.s2 >> The use of drugs that stimulate alpha-adrenergic receptors (e.g., phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine or dihydroergotamine) may enhance or potentiate the pressor effects of ProAmatine   . Therefore, caution should be used when ProAmatine    is administered concomitantly with agents that cause vasoconstriction. >> 66-78,81-95,98-106,109-127,132-148,200-209,254-263

DDI-DrugBank.d603.s4 >> The potential for supine hypertension should be carefully monitored in these patients and may be minimized by either reducing the dose of fludrocortisone acetate or decreasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with. >> 138-160
DDI-DrugBank.d603.s5 >> ProAmatine. Alpha-adrenergic blocking agents, such as prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin, can antagonize the effects of ProAmatine. Potential for Drug Interactions: It appears possible, although there is no supporting experimental evidence, that the high renal clearance of desglymidodrine (a base) is due to active tubular secretion by the base-secreting system also responsible for the secretion of such drugs as metformin, cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, triamterene, flecainide, and quinidine. >> 0-9,12-43,54-61,64-72,79-87,120-129,274-288,415-423,426-435,438-447,450-461,464-474,477-486,493-501
DDI-DrugBank.d603.s6 >> Thus there may be a potential for drug-drug interactions with these drugs.
