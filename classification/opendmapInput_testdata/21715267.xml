DDI-MedLine.d231.s0 >> Interaction study of moxifloxacin and lomefloxacin with co-administered drugs. >> 21-32,38-49
DDI-MedLine.d231.s1 >> Moxifloxacin and lomefloxacin are fluoroquinolone antibiotics used in treating urinary and respiratory tract infections. >> 0-11,17-28,34-60
DDI-MedLine.d231.s2 >> Fluoroquinolones are known to have interactions with drugs that are active in gastro intestinal tract. >> 0-15
DDI-MedLine.d231.s3 >> Being moxifloxacin and lomefloxacin fluoroquinolones the interaction study of was carried out with sucralfate, gelusil, erythromycin and multi minerals. >> 6-17,36-51,99-108,111-117,120-131,137-150
DDI-MedLine.d231.s4 >> The interaction was studied at neutral, acidic and basic conditions both at room temperature and 37  C.
DDI-MedLine.d231.s5 >> The effect of dissolution medium simulating various body environments with response to pH has been examined in order to elucidate the interactions.
DDI-MedLine.d231.s6 >> The response of moxifloxacin and lomefloxacin after interaction with co-administered drugs at different conditions and temperature were noted using a Shimadzu HPLC system with PDA detector. >> 16-27,33-44
DDI-MedLine.d231.s7 >> It was seen that interaction of these fluoroquinolones was more at 37  C than at room temperature. >> 38-53
DDI-MedLine.d231.s8 >> Moxifloxacin and Lomefloxacin reacts faster with sucralfate and gelusil in acidic media whereas with erythromycin in basic media and multi-minerals in neutral media. >> 0-11,17-28,49-58,64-70,101-112,133-146
DDI-MedLine.d231.s9 >> The study ensures the interaction of fluoroquinolones with selected class of drugs. >> 37-52
DDI-MedLine.d231.s10 >> In order to achieve the effective therapeutic effect appropriate time intervals between administrations of drugs is essential.
