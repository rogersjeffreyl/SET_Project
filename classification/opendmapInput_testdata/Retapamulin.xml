DDI-DrugBank.d654.s0 >> Co-administration of oral ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily increased retapamulin geometric mean AUC(0-24) and Cmax by 81% after topical application of retapamulin ointment, 1% on the abraded skin of healthy adult males. >> 26-37,68-78,150-160
DDI-DrugBank.d654.s1 >> Due to low systemic exposure to retapamulin following topical application in patients, dosage adjustments for retapamulin are unnecessary when co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole. >> 32-42,110-120,191-202
DDI-DrugBank.d654.s2 >> Based on in vitro P450 inhibition studies and the low systemic exposure observed following topical application of ALTABAX, retapamulin is unlikely to affect the metabolism of other P450 substrates. >> 114-120,123-133
DDI-DrugBank.d654.s3 >> The effect of concurrent application of ALTABAX and other topical products to the same area of skin has not been studied. >> 40-46
