DDI-MedLine.d184.s0 >> Amphetamine locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference in adolescent male and female rats neonatally treated with quinpirole. >> 0-10,128-137
DDI-MedLine.d184.s1 >> Neonatal quinpirole treatment has been shown to produce an increase in dopamine D2-like receptor sensitivity that persists throughout the subject's lifetime. >> 9-18
DDI-MedLine.d184.s2 >> The objective was to analyze the effects of neonatal quinpirole treatment on effects of amphetamine in adolescent rats using locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference procedures. >> 53-62,88-98
DDI-MedLine.d184.s3 >> Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with quinpirole (1 mg/kg) or saline from postnatal days (P)1 to P11 and raised to adolescence. >> 38-47
DDI-MedLine.d184.s4 >> For locomotor sensitization, subjects were given amphetamine (1 mg/kg) or saline every second day from P35 to P47 and were placed into a locomotor arena. >> 49-59
DDI-MedLine.d184.s5 >> In female rats, neonatal quinpirole treatment enhanced amphetamine locomotor sensitization compared with quinpirole-free controls sensitized to amphetamine. >> 25-34,55-65,105-114,144-154
DDI-MedLine.d184.s6 >> Male rats demonstrated sensitization to amphetamine, although this was muted compared with female rats, and were unaffected by neonatal quinpirole. >> 40-50,136-145
DDI-MedLine.d184.s7 >> For conditioned place preference, subjects were conditioned for 8 consecutive days (P32-39) with amphetamine (1 mg/kg) or saline and a drug-free preference test was conducted at P40. >> 97-107
DDI-MedLine.d184.s8 >> Rats treated with neonatal quinpirole enhanced time spent in the amphetamine-paired context compared with quinpirole-free controls conditioned with amphetamine, but only female controls conditioned with amphetamine spent more time in the drug-paired context compared with saline-treated controls. >> 27-36,65-75,106-115,148-158,203-213
DDI-MedLine.d184.s9 >> Increased D   -like receptor sensitivity appears to have enhanced the behavioral effects of amphetamine, but these effects were more prevalent in adolescent female rats compared with male rats. >> 92-102
