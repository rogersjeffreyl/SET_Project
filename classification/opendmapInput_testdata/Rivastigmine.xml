DDI-DrugBank.d596.s0 >> Drug-Drug Interactions Effect of Exelon    (rivastigmine tartrate) on the Metabolism of Other Drugs: Rivastigmine is primarily metabolized through hydrolysis by esterases. >> 33-38,44-64,101-112
DDI-DrugBank.d596.s1 >> Minimal metabolism occurs via the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.
DDI-DrugBank.d596.s2 >> Based on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic drug interactions with drugs metabolized by the following isoenzyme systems are expected: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, or CYP2C19.
DDI-DrugBank.d596.s3 >> No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam, or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. >> 52-63,69-75,78-85,88-95,101-110
DDI-DrugBank.d596.s4 >> The elevation of prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not affected by administration of Exelon. >> 45-52,91-96
DDI-DrugBank.d596.s5 >> Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Exelon: Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP450 metabolism are not expected to alter the metabolism of rivastigmine. >> 43-48,142-153
DDI-DrugBank.d596.s6 >> Single dose pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of rivastigmine is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin, warfarin, diazepam, or fluoxetine. >> 72-83,147-153,156-163,166-173,179-188
DDI-DrugBank.d596.s7 >> Population PK analysis with a database of 625 patients showed that the pharmacokinetics of rivastigmine were not influenced by commonly prescribed medications such as antacids (n=77), antihypertensives (n=72), calcium channel blockers (n=75), antidiabetics (n=21), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n=79), estrogens (n=70), salicylate analgesics (n=177), antianginals (n=35), and antihistamines (n=15). >> 91-102,167-174,184-200,210-233,243-255,265-300,310-318,328-348,359-370,384-397
DDI-DrugBank.d596.s8 >> Use with Anticholinergics: Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. >> 9-24,65-89,144-170
DDI-DrugBank.d596.s9 >> Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors: A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol. >> 9-23,35-59,104-128,158-172,183-211,216-235,245-255
