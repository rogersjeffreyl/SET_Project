DDI-DrugBank.d665.s0 >> Concurrent administration of bacteriostatic antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, tetracycline) may diminish the bactericidal effects of penicillins by slowing the rate of bacterial growth. >> 29-54,63-74,77-88,132-142
DDI-DrugBank.d665.s1 >> Bactericidal agents work most effectively against the immature cell wall of rapidly proliferating microorganisms.
DDI-DrugBank.d665.s2 >> This has been demonstrated in vitro;
DDI-DrugBank.d665.s3 >> however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented.
DDI-DrugBank.d665.s4 >> There are few clinical situations in which the concurrent use of ''static'' and ''cidal '' antibiotics are indicated. >> 91-101
DDI-DrugBank.d665.s5 >> However, in selected circumstances in which such therapy is appropriate, using adequate doses of antibacterial agents and beginning penicillin therapy first, should minimize the potential for interaction. >> 97-109
DDI-DrugBank.d665.s6 >> Penicillin blood levels may be prolonged by concurrent administration of probenecid which blocks the renal tubular secretion of penicillins. >> 0-9,73-82,128-138
DDI-DrugBank.d665.s7 >> Displacement of penicillin from plasma protein binding sites will elevate the level of free penicillin in the serum. >> 16-25,92-101
