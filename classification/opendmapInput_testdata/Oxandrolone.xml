DDI-DrugBank.d584.s0 >> Anticoagulants Anabolic steroids may increase sensitivity to oral anticoagulants. >> 0-13,15-31,66-79
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s1 >> Dosage of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased in order to maintain desired prothrombin time. >> 14-26
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s2 >> Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy require close monitoring, especially when anabolic steroids are started or stopped. >> 88-104
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s3 >> Warfarin: A multidose study of oxandrolone, given as 5 or 10 mg BID in 15 healthy subjects concurrently treated with warfarin, resulted in a mean increase in S-warfarin half-life from 26 to 48 hours and AUC from 4.55 to 12.08 ng*hr/mL: similar increases in R-warfarin half-life and AUC were also detected. >> 0-7,31-41,117-124,158-167,257-266
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s4 >> Microscopic hematuria (9/15) and gingival bleeding (1/15) were also observed.
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s5 >> A 5.5-fold decrease in the mean warfarin dose from 6.13 mg/day to 1.13 mg/day (approximately 80-85% reduction of warfarin dose), was necessary to maintain a target INR of 1.5. >> 32-39,113-120
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s6 >> When oxandrolone therapy is initiated in a patient already receiving treatment with warfarin, the INR or prothrombin time (PT) should be monitored closely and the dose of warfarin adjusted as necessary until a stable target INR or PT has been achieved. >> 5-15,84-91,171-178
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s7 >> Furthermore, in patients receiving both drugs, careful monitoring of the INR or PT, and adjustment of the warfarin dosage if indicated are recommended when the oxandrolone dose is changed or discontinued. >> 106-113,160-170
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s8 >> Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of occult bleeding.
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s9 >> Oral hypoglycemic agents Oxandrolone may inhibit the metabolism of oral hypoglycemic agents. >> 5-23,25-35,72-90
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s10 >> Adrenal steroids or ACTH In patients with edema, concomitant administration with adrenal cortical steroids or ACTH may increase the edema. >> 0-15,20-23,81-105,110-113
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s11 >> Drug/Laboratory test interactions Anabolic steroids may decrease levels of thyroxine-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. >> 34-50
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s12 >> Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged.
DDI-DrugBank.d584.s13 >> In addition, a decrease in PBI and radioactive iodine uptake may occur.
