DDI-MedLine.d169.s0 >> Calcium does not inhibit the absorption of 5 milligrams of nonheme or heme iron at doses less than 800 milligrams in nonpregnant women. >> 0-6,59-65;75-78,70-78
DDI-MedLine.d169.s1 >> Calcium is the only known component in the diet that may affect absorption of both nonheme and heme iron. >> 0-6,83-89;100-103,95-103
DDI-MedLine.d169.s2 >> However, the evidence for a calcium effect on iron absorption mainly comes from studies that did not isolate the effect of calcium from that of other dietary components, because it was detected in single-meal studies. >> 28-34,46-49,123-129
DDI-MedLine.d169.s3 >> Our objective was to establish potential effects of calcium on absorption of nonheme and heme iron and the dose response for this effect in the absence of a meal. >> 52-58,77-83;94-97,89-97
DDI-MedLine.d169.s4 >> Fifty-four healthy, nonpregnant women were selected to participate in 4 iron absorption studies using iron radioactive tracers. >> 72-75
DDI-MedLine.d169.s5 >> We evaluated the effects of calcium doses between 200 and 1500 mg on absorption of 5 mg nonheme iron (as ferrous sulfate). >> 28-34,88-99,105-119
DDI-MedLine.d169.s6 >> We also evaluated the effects of calcium doses between 200 and 800 mg on absorption of 5 mg heme iron [as concentrated RBC (CRBC)]. >> 33-39,92-100
DDI-MedLine.d169.s7 >> Calcium was administered as calcium chloride in all studies and minerals were ingested on an empty stomach. >> 0-6,28-43,64-71
DDI-MedLine.d169.s8 >> Calcium doses   1000 mg diminished nonheme iron absorption by an average of 49.6%. >> 0-6,35-46
DDI-MedLine.d169.s9 >> A calcium dose of 800 mg diminished absorption of 5 mg heme iron by 37.7%. >> 2-8,55-63
DDI-MedLine.d169.s10 >> In conclusion, we demonstrated an isolated effect of calcium (as chloride) on absorption of 5 mg of iron provided as nonheme (as sulfate) and heme (as CRBC) iron. >> 53-59,117-123;157-160,142-145;157-160
DDI-MedLine.d169.s11 >> This effect was observed at doses higher than previously reported from single-meal studies, starting at ~800 mg of calcium. >> 115-121
