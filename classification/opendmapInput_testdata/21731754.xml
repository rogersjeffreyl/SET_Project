DDI-MedLine.d218.s0 >> Antidepressant-warfarin interaction and associated gastrointestinal bleeding risk in a case-control study. >> 0-13,15-22
DDI-MedLine.d218.s1 >> Bleeding is the most common and worrisome adverse effect of warfarin therapy. >> 60-67
DDI-MedLine.d218.s2 >> One of the factors that might increase bleeding risk is initiation of interacting drugs that potentiate warfarin. >> 104-111
DDI-MedLine.d218.s3 >> We sought to evaluate whether initiation of an antidepressant increases the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding in warfarin users. >> 47-60,133-140
DDI-MedLine.d218.s4 >> Medicaid claims data (1999-2005) were used to perform an observational case-control study nested within person-time exposed to warfarin in those   18 years. >> 127-134
DDI-MedLine.d218.s5 >> In total, 430,455 warfarin users contributed 407,370 person-years of warfarin use. >> 18-25,69-76
DDI-MedLine.d218.s6 >> The incidence rate of hospitalization for GI bleeding among warfarin users was 4.48 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 4.42-4.55). >> 60-67
DDI-MedLine.d218.s7 >> Each gastrointestinal bleeding cases was matched to 50 controls based on index date and state.
DDI-MedLine.d218.s8 >> Warfarin users had an increased odds ratio of gastrointestinal bleeding upon initiation of citalopram (OR   =   1.73 [95% CI, 1.25-2.38]), fluoxetine (OR   =   1.63 [95% CI, 1.11-2.38]), paroxetine (OR   =   1.64 [95% CI, 1.27-2.12]), amitriptyline (OR   =   1.47 [95% CI, 1.02-2.11]). >> 0-7,91-100,139-148,187-196,235-247
DDI-MedLine.d218.s9 >> Also mirtazapine, which is not believed to interact with warfarin, increased the risk of GI bleeding (OR   =   1.75 [95% CI, 1.30-2.35]). >> 5-15,57-64
DDI-MedLine.d218.s10 >> Warfarin users who initiated citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, amitriptyline, or mirtazapine had an increased risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding. >> 0-7,29-38,41-50,53-62,65-77,83-93
DDI-MedLine.d218.s11 >> However, the elevated risk with mirtazapine suggests that a drug-drug interaction may not have been responsible for all of the observed increased risk. >> 32-42
