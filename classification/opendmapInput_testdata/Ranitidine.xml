DDI-DrugBank.d590.s0 >> Coadministration of TRITEC with clarithromycin resulted in increased plasma ranitidine concentrations (57%), increased plasma bismuth trough concentrations (48%), and increased 14- hydroxy- clarithromycin plasma concentrations (31%). >> 20-25,32-45,76-85,177-203
DDI-DrugBank.d590.s1 >> Coadministration with aspirin results in a slight decrease in the rate of salicylate absorption that is clinically unimportant. >> 22-28,74-83
DDI-DrugBank.d590.s2 >> Coadministration with a high dose of antacid (170 mEq) results in a 28% decrease in plasma concentrations of ranitidine and may decrease plasma concentrations of bismuth from TRITEC. >> 37-43,109-118,175-180
DDI-DrugBank.d590.s3 >> These effects are clinically insignificant.
