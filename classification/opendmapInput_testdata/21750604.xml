DDI-MedLine.d190.s0 >> Glycosidic enzymes enhance retinal transduction following intravitreal delivery of AAV2. >> 83-86
DDI-MedLine.d190.s1 >> To determine whether the co-injection of extracellular matrix degrading enzymes improves retinal transduction following intravitreal delivery of adeno-associated virus-2 (AAV2). >> 145-168,171-174
DDI-MedLine.d190.s2 >> AAV2 containing cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP), under the control of a chicken   -actin promoter, was delivered by intravitreal injection to adult mice in conjunction with enzymes including collagenase, hyaluronan lyase, heparinase III, or chondroitin ABC lyase. >> 0-3,214-224,227-242,245-258,264-284
DDI-MedLine.d190.s3 >> Two weeks later, retinal flatmounts were examined for GFP expression using confocal microscopy.
DDI-MedLine.d190.s4 >> Without the addition of enzymes, transduction was limited to occasional cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer.
DDI-MedLine.d190.s5 >> The addition of heparinase III or chondroitin ABC lyase greatly enhanced transduction of the retinal ganglion cell layer and increased the depth of transduction into the outer retina. >> 16-29,34-54
DDI-MedLine.d190.s6 >> Hyaluronan lyase had a limited effect and collagenase was ineffective. >> 0-15,42-52
DDI-MedLine.d190.s7 >> Electroretinograms survived with higher concentrations of heparinase III and chondroitin ABC lyase than were required for optimal retinal transduction. >> 58-71,77-97
DDI-MedLine.d190.s8 >> AAV2-mediated retinal transduction is improved by co-injection of heparinase III or chondroitin ABC lyase. >> 0-3,66-79,84-104
DDI-MedLine.d190.s9 >> Improved transduction efficiency may allow intravitreal injection to become the preferred route for delivering gene therapy to both the inner and outer retina.
