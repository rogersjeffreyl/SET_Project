DDI-DrugBank.d628.s2 >> These agents may increase the anesthetic or sedative effects of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion and may also result in more pronounced decreases in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures and cardiac output. >> 64-71
DDI-DrugBank.d628.s3 >> During maintenance of anesthesia or sedation, the rate of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion administration should be adjusted according to the desired level of anesthesia or sedation and may be reduced in the presence of supplemental analgesic agents (eg, nitrous oxide or opioids). >> 58-65,229-244,251-263,268-274
DDI-DrugBank.d628.s4 >> The concurrent administration of potent inhalational agents (eg, isoflurane, enflurane, and halothane) during maintenance with DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion has not been extensively evaluated. >> 65-74,77-85,92-100,127-134
DDI-DrugBank.d628.s5 >> These inhalational agents can also be expected to increase the anesthetic or sedative and cardiorespiratory effects of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion. >> 119-126
DDI-DrugBank.d628.s6 >> DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion does not cause a clinically significant change in onset, intensity, or duration of action of the commonly used neuromuscular blocking agents (eg, succinylcholine and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants). >> 0-7,140-168,175-189,195-226
DDI-DrugBank.d628.s7 >> No significant adverse interactions with commonly used premedications or drugs used during anesthesia or sedation (including a range of muscle relaxants, inhalational agents, analgesic agents, and local anesthetic agents) have been observed. >> 136-151,175-190,203-219
