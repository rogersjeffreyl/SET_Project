DDI-MedLine.d194.s5 >> The roles of p27(Kip1), Bcl-2, and Cdk1 in apoptosis induced by dasatinib and paclitaxel were assessed using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, siRNA knockdown of gene expression, transfection with Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression vectors, and flow cytometry. >> 64-72,78-87
DDI-MedLine.d194.s6 >> All statistical tests were two-sided.
DDI-MedLine.d194.s7 >> Src family and Abl kinases were identified as modulators of paclitaxel sensitivity in SKOv3 cells. >> 60-69
DDI-MedLine.d194.s8 >> The siRNA knockdown of Src, Fyn, or Abl1 enhanced paclitaxel-mediated growth inhibition in ovarian cancer cells compared with a control siRNA. >> 50-59
DDI-MedLine.d194.s9 >> HEY cells treated with dasatinib plus paclitaxel formed fewer colonies than did cells treated with either agent alone. >> 23-31,38-47
DDI-MedLine.d194.s10 >> Treatment of HEY xenograft-bearing mice with dasatinib plus paclitaxel inhibited tumor growth more than treatment with either agent alone (average tumor volume per mouse, dasatinib + paclitaxel vs paclitaxel: 0.28 vs. 0.81 cm3, difference = 0.53 cm3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.44 to 0.62 cm3, P = .014); >> 45-53,60-69,171-179,183-192,197-206

DDI-MedLine.d194.s14 >> Combined treatment induced more TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells than did either agent alone.
DDI-MedLine.d194.s15 >> The siRNA knockdown of p27(Kip1) decreased dasatinib- and paclitaxel-induced apoptosis compared with a negative control siRNA (sub-G1 fraction, control siRNA vs. p27(Kip1) siRNA: 42.5% vs. 20.1%, difference = 22.4%, 95% CI = 20.1% to 24.7%, P = .017). >> 43-51,58-67
DDI-MedLine.d194.s16 >> Studies with forced expression and siRNA knockdown of Bcl-2 and Cdk1 suggest that dasatinib-mediated induction of p27(Kip1) enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis by negatively regulating Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression. >> 82-90,133-142
DDI-MedLine.d194.s17 >> Inhibition of Src family and Abl kinases with either siRNAs or dasatinib enhances paclitaxel sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells through p27(Kip1)-mediated suppression of Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression. >> 63-71,82-91
