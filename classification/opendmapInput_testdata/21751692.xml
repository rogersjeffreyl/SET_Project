DDI-MedLine.d199.s1 >> Emergence agitation (EA) can be a distressing side effect of pediatric anesthesia.
DDI-MedLine.d199.s2 >> We retrospectively reviewed the records of 7 pediatric oncology patients who received low-dose ketamine in conjunction with propofol for total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) repeatedly for radiation therapy. >> 95-102,124-131
DDI-MedLine.d199.s3 >> EA signs were observed in all 7 patients in association with propofol TIVA but did not recur in any of 123 subsequent anesthetics sessions during which low-dose ketamine was added to propofol. >> 61-68,161-168,183-190
DDI-MedLine.d199.s4 >> Based on this experience, we suggest that low-dose ketamine added to propofol may be associated with prevention of EA in children with a history of EA with propofol TIVA. >> 51-58,69-76,156-163
