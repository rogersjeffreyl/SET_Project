DDI-DrugBank.d680.s0 >> Pantoprazole is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system, primarily the CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 isozymes, and subsequently undergoes Phase II conjugation. >> 0-11
DDI-DrugBank.d680.s1 >> Based on studies evaluating possible interactions of pantoprazole with other drugs, no dosage adjustment is needed with concomitant use of the following: theophylline, cisapride, antipyrine, caffeine, carbamazepine, diazepam (and its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam), diclofenac, naproxen, piroxicam, digoxin, ethanol, glyburide, an oral contraceptive (levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol), metoprolol, nifedipine, phenytoin, warfarin, midazolam, clarithromycin, metronidazole, or amoxicillin. >> 53-64,154-165,168-176,179-188,191-198,201-213,216-223,253-269,273-282,285-292,295-303,306-312,315-321,324-332,343-355,358-371,373-389,393-402,405-414,417-425,428-435,438-446,449-462,465-477,483-493
DDI-DrugBank.d680.s2 >> Clinically relevant interactions of pantoprazole with other drugs with the same metabolic pathways are not expected. >> 36-47
DDI-DrugBank.d680.s3 >> Therefore, when coadministered with pantoprazole, adjustment of the dosage of pantoprazole or of such drugs may not be necessary. >> 36-47,78-89
DDI-DrugBank.d680.s4 >> There was also no interaction with concomitantly administered antacids. >> 62-69
DDI-DrugBank.d680.s5 >> There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. >> 98-119,132-143,150-157
DDI-DrugBank.d680.s6 >> Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death.
DDI-DrugBank.d680.s7 >> Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. >> 22-43,49-56
DDI-DrugBank.d680.s8 >> Because of profound and long lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (eg, ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). >> 75-86,202-213,216-225,239-242
DDI-DrugBank.d680.s9 >> Laboratory Tests There have been reports of false-positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving most proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole. >> 85-104,107-109,139-160,173-184
DDI-DrugBank.d680.s10 >> An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results.
