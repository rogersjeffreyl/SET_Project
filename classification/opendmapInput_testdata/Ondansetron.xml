DDI-DrugBank.d763.s0 >> Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. >> 0-10
DDI-DrugBank.d763.s1 >> Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. >> 8-18,209-219
DDI-DrugBank.d763.s2 >> On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs.
DDI-DrugBank.d763.s3 >> Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin: In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. >> 0-8,11-23,30-39,100-108,111-123,130-139,160-170,204-214
DDI-DrugBank.d763.s4 >> However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3  Tramadol: Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5  Chemotherapy: Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P 388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. >> 66-76,126-133,189-199,205-212,273-283,360-367,472-482
DDI-DrugBank.d763.s5 >> In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. >> 11-20,23-31,38-46,86-96
DDI-DrugBank.d763.s6 >> In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V.
