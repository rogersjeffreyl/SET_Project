DDI-MedLine.d180.s0 >> Determinants of sensitivity to DZNep induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells. >> 31-35
DDI-MedLine.d180.s1 >> The 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), one of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase inhibitors, has shown antitumor activities in a broad range of solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia. >> 4-22,25-29
DDI-MedLine.d180.s2 >> Here, we examined its effects on multiple myeloma (MM) cells and found that, at 500 nM, it potently inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in 2 of 8 MM cell lines.
DDI-MedLine.d180.s3 >> RNA from un-treated and DZNep treated cells was profiled by Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray and genes with a significant change in gene expression were determined by significance analysis of microarray (SAM) testing. >> 24-28
DDI-MedLine.d180.s4 >> ALOX5 was the most down-regulated gene (5.8-fold) in sensitive cells and was expressed at low level in resistant cells.
DDI-MedLine.d180.s5 >> The results were corroborated by quantitative RT-PCR.
DDI-MedLine.d180.s6 >> Western-blot analysis indicated ALOX5 was highly expressed only in sensitive cell line H929 and greatly decreased upon DZNep treatment. >> 119-123
DDI-MedLine.d180.s7 >> Ectopic expression of ALOX5 reduced sensitivity to DZNep in H929 cells. >> 51-55
DDI-MedLine.d180.s8 >> Furthermore, down-regulation of ALOX5 by RNA interference could also induce apoptosis in H929.
DDI-MedLine.d180.s9 >> Gene expression analysis on MM patient dataset indicated ALOX5 expression was significantly higher in MM patients compared to normal plasma cells.
DDI-MedLine.d180.s10 >> We also found that Bcl-2 was overexpressed in DZNep insensitive cells, and cotreatment with DZNep and ABT-737, a Bcl-2 family inhibitor, synergistically inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of DZNep insensitive MM cells. >> 46-50,92-96,102-108,195-199
DDI-MedLine.d180.s11 >> Taken together, this study shows one of mechanisms of the DZNep efficacy on MM correlates with its ability to down-regulate the ALOX5 levels. >> 58-62
DDI-MedLine.d180.s12 >> In addition, DZNep insensitivity might be associated with overexpression of Bcl-2, and the combination of ABT-737 and DZNep could synergistically induced apoptosis. >> 13-17,106-112,118-122
DDI-MedLine.d180.s13 >> These results suggest that DZNep may be exploited therapeutically for a subset of MM. >> 27-31
