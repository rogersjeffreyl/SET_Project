DDI-MedLine.d185.s0 >> Effect of ketoconazole-mediated CYP3A4 inhibition on clinical pharmacokinetics of panobinostat (LBH589), an orally active histone deacetylase inhibitor. >> 10-21,82-93,96-101,122-150
DDI-MedLine.d185.s1 >> Panobinostat is partly metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro. >> 0-11
DDI-MedLine.d185.s2 >> This study evaluated the effect of a potent CYP3A inhibitor, ketoconazole, on the pharmacokinetics and safety of panobinostat. >> 61-72,113-124
DDI-MedLine.d185.s3 >> Patients received a single panobinostat oral dose on day 1, followed by 4  days wash-out period. >> 27-38
DDI-MedLine.d185.s4 >> On days 5-9, ketoconazole was administered. >> 13-24
DDI-MedLine.d185.s5 >> On day 8, a single panobinostat dose was co-administered with ketoconazole. >> 19-30,62-73
DDI-MedLine.d185.s6 >> Panobinostat was administered as single agent three times a week on day 15 and onward. >> 0-11
DDI-MedLine.d185.s7 >> In the presence of ketoconazole, there was 1.6- and 1.8-fold increase in C (max) and AUC of panobinostat, respectively. >> 19-30,92-103
DDI-MedLine.d185.s8 >> No substantial change in T (max) or half-life was observed.
DDI-MedLine.d185.s9 >> No difference in panobinostat-pharmacokinetics between patients carrying CYP3A5*1/*3 and CYP3A5*3/*3 alleles was observed. >> 17-28
DDI-MedLine.d185.s10 >> Most frequently reported adverse events were gastrointestinal related.
DDI-MedLine.d185.s11 >> Patients had asymptomatic hypophosphatemia (64%), and urine analysis suggested renal phosphate wasting.
DDI-MedLine.d185.s12 >> Co-administration of panobinostat with CYP3A inhibitors is feasible as the observed increase in panobinostat PK parameters was not considered clinically relevant. >> 21-32,96-107
DDI-MedLine.d185.s13 >> Considering the variability in exposure following enzyme inhibition and the fact that chronic dosing of panobinostat was not studied with CYP3A inhibitors, close monitoring of panobinostat-related adverse events is necessary. >> 104-115,176-187
