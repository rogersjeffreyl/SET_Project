DDI-DrugBank.d775.s0 >> Although MIVACRON (a mixture of three stereoisomers) has been administered safely following succinylcholine-facilitated tracheal intubation, the interaction between MIVACRON and succinylcholine has not been systematically studied. >> 9-16,165-172,178-192
DDI-DrugBank.d775.s1 >> Prior administration of succinylcholine can potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effects of nondepolarizing agents. >> 24-38,93-114
DDI-DrugBank.d775.s2 >> Evidence of spontaneous recovery from succinylcholine should be observed before the administration of MIVACRON. >> 38-52,102-109
DDI-DrugBank.d775.s3 >> The use of MIVACRON before succinylcholine to attenuate some of the side effects of succinylcholine has not been studied. >> 11-18,27-41,84-98
DDI-DrugBank.d775.s4 >> There are no clinical data on the use of MIVACRON with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. >> 41-48,61-105

DDI-DrugBank.d775.s6 >> decrease the ED50 of MIVACRON by as much as 25% (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics and Individualization of Dosages). >> 21-28
DDI-DrugBank.d775.s7 >> These agents may also prolong the clinically effective duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement of MIVACRON by as much as 35% to 40%. >> 123-130
DDI-DrugBank.d775.s8 >> A greater potentiation of the neuromuscular blocking effects of MIVACRON may be expected with higher concentrations of enflurane or isoflurane. >> 64-71,119-127,132-141
DDI-DrugBank.d775.s9 >> Halothane has little or no effect on the ED50 , but may prolong the duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement by as much as 20%. >> 0-8
DDI-DrugBank.d775.s10 >> Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as MIVACRON include certain antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine. >> 67-88,98-105,123-133,142-156,159-171,174-183,186-195,198-207,210-220,223-230,237-257,261-269,278-284,293-303,306-317,324-332
DDI-DrugBank.d775.s11 >> The neuromuscular blocking effect of MIVACRON may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity (e.g., chronically administered oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase . Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered phenytoin or carbamazepine. >> 37-44,151-164,167-181,195-222,354-382,443-451,456-468
DDI-DrugBank.d775.s12 >> While the effects of chronic phenytoin or carbamazepine therapy on the action of MIVACRON are unknown, slightly shorter durations of neuromuscular block may be anticipated and infusion rate requirements may be higher. >> 29-37,42-54,81-88
DDI-DrugBank.d775.s13 >> Some drug interactions are:  - birth control pills - corticosteroids - medicines for angina or high blood pressure - medicines for pain - medicines to control seizures such as phenytoin or carbamazepine - certain antibiotics given by injection - cisplatin - edrophonium - neostigmine - polymyxin B or bacitracin - local anesthetics such as procaine - general anesthetics - succinylcholine or other muscle relaxants >> 53-67,176-184,189-201,213-223,246-254,258-268,272-282,286-296,301-310,320-330,340-347,359-369,373-387,398-413
