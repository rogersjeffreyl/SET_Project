DDI-MedLine.d200.s0 >> [Efficacy of fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan in hospitalized patients with hypertensive disease] >> 31-40,42-50
DDI-MedLine.d200.s1 >> Efficacy and tolerability of fixed amlodipine/valsartan combination was studied in 86 patients with hypertensive disease hospitalized in departments of general internal medicine or cardiology. >> 35-44,46-54
DDI-MedLine.d200.s2 >> All patients had indications for antihypertensive therapy and were randomized either to fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan (n=43) or to therapy which corresponded to the hospital formulary (n=43). >> 106-115,117-125
DDI-MedLine.d200.s3 >> Correction of antihypertensive therapy was performed by treating physician at daily rounds. >> 14-29
DDI-MedLine.d200.s4 >> Self-control of blood pressure (BP) was performed by patients with the use of UA767PC apparatus.
DDI-MedLine.d200.s5 >> Results of BP self-control were compared with clinical measurements in order to detect concealed inefficacy of treatment.
DDI-MedLine.d200.s6 >> Results.
DDI-MedLine.d200.s7 >> Rate of achievement of target BP with fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan (93%) was comparable with that on traditional therapy (90%). >> 56-65,67-75
DDI-MedLine.d200.s8 >> But the use of fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan compared with traditional therapy was associated with lower clinical and self measured BP, quicker achievement of target BP (5.8+/-2.3 and 9.2+/-1.8 days, respectively, 0.05), lesser number of antihypertensive drugs (2.5+/-0.6 and 3.0+/-0.9 days, respectively), lower rate of concealed inefficacy of treatment (12 and 31%, respectively, 0.05). >> 33-42,44-52,247-268
DDI-MedLine.d200.s9 >> Conclusions.
DDI-MedLine.d200.s10 >> We have demonstrated appropriateness of inhospital administration of fixed amlodipine/valsartan combination as an approach allowing to achieve target BP in shorter time, with the use of fewer antihypertensive drugs, and diminishing concealed inefficacy of treatment. >> 75-84,86-94,192-213
