DDI-DrugBank.d633.s0 >> Since MEXITIL is a substrate for the metabolic pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 enzymes, inhibition or induction of either of these enzymes would be expected to alter mexiletine plasma concentrations. >> 6-12,171-180
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s1 >> In a formal, single-dose interaction study (n = 6 males) the clearance of mexiletine was decreased by 38% following the coadministration of fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP1A2. >> 74-83,140-150
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s2 >> In another formal study (n = 8 extensive and n = 7 poor metabolizers of CYP2D6), coadministration of propafenone did not alter the kinetics of mexiletine in the poor CYP2D6 metabolizer group. >> 101-111,143-152
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s3 >> However, the metabolic clearance of mexiletine in the extensive metabolizer phenotype decreased by about 70% making the poor and extensive metabolizer groups indistinguishable. >> 36-45
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s4 >> In this crossover steady state study, the pharmacokinetics of propafenone were unaffected in either phenotype by the coadministration of mexiletine. >> 62-72,137-146
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s5 >> Addition of mexiletine to propafenone did not lead to further electrocardiographic parameters changes of QRS, QTc, RR, and PR intervals than propafenone alone. >> 12-21,26-36,141-151
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s6 >> When concomitant administration of either of these two drugs with mexiletine is initiated, the dose of mexiletine should be slowly titrated to desired effect. >> 66-75,103-112
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s7 >> In a large compassionate use program Mexitil    has been used concurrently with commonly employed antianginal, antihypertensive, and anticoagulant drugs without observed interactions. >> 37-43,111-126,133-151
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s8 >> A variety of antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propranolol were also added, sometimes with improved control of ventricular ectopy. >> 13-27,37-45,50-60
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s9 >> When phenytoin or other hepatic enzyme inducers such as rifampin and phenobarbital have been taken concurrently with Mexitil   , lowered Mexitil    plasma levels have been reported. >> 5-13,56-63,69-81,117-123,137-143
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s10 >> Monitoring of Mexitil    plasma levels is recommended during such concurrent use to avoid ineffective therapy. >> 14-20
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s11 >> In a formal study, benzodiazepines were shown not to affect Mexitil    plasma concentrations. >> 19-33,60-66
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s12 >> ECG intervals (PR, QRS, and QT) were not affected by concurrent Mexitil    and digoxin, diuretics, or propranolol. >> 64-70,79-85,88-96,102-112
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s13 >> Concurrent administration of cimetidine and Mexitil    has been reported to increase, decrease, or leave unchanged Mexitil    plasma levels; >> 29-38,44-50,115-121
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s14 >> therefore patients should be followed carefully during concurrent therapy.
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s15 >> Mexitil    does not alter serum digoxin levels but magnesium-aluminum hydroxide, when used to treat gastrointestinal symptoms due to Mexitil   , has been reported to lower serum digoxin levels. >> 0-6,32-38,51-78,133-139,178-184
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s16 >> Concurrent use of Mexitil    and theophylline may lead to increased plasma theophylline levels. >> 18-24,33-44,75-86
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s17 >> One controlled study in eight normal subjects showed a 72% mean increase (range 35-136%) in plasma theophylline levels. >> 99-110
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s18 >> This increase was observed at the first test point which was the second day after starting Mexitil   . Theophylline plasma levels returned to pre-Mexitil    values within 48 hours after discontinuing Mexitil   . If Mexitil and theophylline are to be used concurrently, theophylline blood levels should be monitored, particularly when the Mexitil    dose is changed. >> 91-97,103-114,146-152,200-206,215-221,227-238,269-280,338-344
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s19 >> An appropriate adjustment in theophylline dose should be considered. >> 29-40
DDI-DrugBank.d633.s20 >> Additionally, in one controlled study in five normal subjects and seven patients, the clearance of caffeine was decreased 50% following the administration of Mexitil   . >> 99-106,158-164
