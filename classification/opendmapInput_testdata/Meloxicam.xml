DDI-DrugBank.d597.s2 >> Aspirin: Concomitant administration of aspirin (1000 mg TID) to healthy volunteers tended to increase the AUC (10%) and Cmax (24%) of meloxicam. >> 0-6,39-45,134-142
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s3 >> The clinical significance of this interaction is not known;
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s4 >> however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of meloxicam and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects. >> 23-28,61-69,75-81
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s5 >> Concomitant administration of low-dose aspirin with MOBIC may result in an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of MOBIC alone. >> 39-45,52-56,150-154
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s6 >> MOBIC is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis. >> 0-4,30-36
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s7 >> Cholestyramine: Pretreatment for four days with cholestyramine significantly increased the clearance of meloxicam by 50%. >> 0-13,48-61,104-112
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s8 >> This resulted in a decrease in t1/2, from 19.2 hours to 12.5 hours, and a 35% reduction in AUC.
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s9 >> This suggests the existence of a recirculation pathway for meloxicam in the gastrointestinal tract. >> 59-67
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s10 >> The clinical relevance of this interaction has not been established.
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s11 >> Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of 200 mg cimetidine QID did not alter the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 30 mg meloxicam. >> 0-9,49-58,120-128
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s12 >> Digoxin: Meloxicam 15 mg once daily for 7 days did not alter the plasma concentration profile of digoxin after b-acetyldigoxin administration for 7 days at clinical doses. >> 0-6,9-17,97-103
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s13 >> In vitro testing found no protein binding drug interaction between digoxin and meloxicam. >> 67-73,79-87
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s14 >> Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics in some patients. >> 0-9,86-91,130-139,145-162
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s15 >> This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s16 >> Studies with furosemide agents and meloxicam have not demonstrated a reduction in natriuretic effect. >> 13-22,35-43
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s17 >> Furosemide: single and multiple dose pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are not affected by multiple doses of meloxicam. >> 0-9,113-121
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s18 >> Nevertheless, during concomitant therapy with furosemide and MOBIC, patients should be observed closely for signs of declining renal function, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. >> 46-55,61-65
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s19 >> Lithium: In clinical trials, NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. >> 0-6,29-34,73-79,113-119
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s20 >> In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean pre-dose lithium concentration and AUC were increased by 21% in subjects receiving lithium doses ranging from 804 to 1072 mg BID with meloxicam 15 mg QD as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone. >> 56-62,130-136,181-189,234-240
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s21 >> These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by MOBIC. >> 85-89
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s22 >> Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when MOBIC is introduced or withdrawn. >> 12-18,63-67
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s23 >> Methotrexate: A study in 13 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients evaluated the effects of multiple doses of meloxicam on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate taken once weekly. >> 0-11,106-114,143-154
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s24 >> Meloxicam did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of methotrexate. >> 0-8,87-98
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s25 >> In vitro, methotrexate did not displace meloxicam from its human serum binding sites. >> 10-21,40-48
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s26 >> Warfarin: Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing MOBIC therapy in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding. >> 0-7,118-122,154-161
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s27 >> The effect of meloxicam on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily doses of warfarin that produced an INR (International Normalized Ratio) between 1.2 and 1.8. >> 14-22,55-62,132-139
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s28 >> In these subjects, meloxicam did not alter warfarin pharmacokinetics and the average anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time. >> 19-27,43-50,109-116
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s29 >> However, one subject showed an increase in INR from 1.5 to 2.1.
DDI-DrugBank.d597.s30 >> Caution should be used when administering MOBIC with warfarin since patients on warfarin may experience changes in INR and an increased risk of bleeding complications when a new medication is introduced. >> 42-46,53-60,80-87
