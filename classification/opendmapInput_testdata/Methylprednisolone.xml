DDI-DrugBank.d578.s0 >> The pharmacokinetic interactions listed below are potentially clinically important.
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s1 >> Mutual inhibition of metabolism occurs with concurrent use of cyclosporin and methylprednisolone; >> 62-72,78-95
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s2 >> therefore, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur.
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s3 >> convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporin. >> 54-71,77-87
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s4 >> Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampin may increase the clearance of methylprednisolone and may require increased in methylprednisolone dose to achieve the desired response. >> 42-54,57-65,72-79,111-128,159-176
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s5 >> Drugs such as troleandomycin and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of methylprednisolone and thus decrease its clearance. >> 14-27,33-44,76-93
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s6 >> Therefore, the dose of methylprednisolone should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity. >> 23-40
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s7 >> Methylprednisolone may increase the clearance of chronic high dose aspirin. >> 0-17,67-73
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s8 >> This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when methylprednisolone is withdrawn. >> 29-38,77-86,102-119
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s9 >> Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients suffering from hypoprothrombinemia. >> 0-6,54-68
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s10 >> The effect of methylprednisolone on oral anticoagulants is variable. >> 14-31,41-54
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s11 >> There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulant when given concurrently with corticosteroids. >> 63-75,106-120
DDI-DrugBank.d578.s12 >> Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.
