DDI-MedLine.d204.s0 >> Distinct synergistic action of piperacillin and methylglyoxal against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. >> 31-42,48-60
DDI-MedLine.d204.s1 >> The dicarbonyl compound methylglyoxal is a natural constituent of Manuka honey produced from Manuka flowers in New Zealand. >> 24-36
DDI-MedLine.d204.s2 >> It is known to possess both anticancer and antibacterial activity.
DDI-MedLine.d204.s3 >> Such observations prompted to investigate the ability of methylglyoxal as a potent drug against multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. >> 57-69
DDI-MedLine.d204.s4 >> A total of 12 test P.
DDI-MedLine.d204.s5 >> aeruginosa strains isolated from various hospitals were tested for their resistances against many antibiotics, most of which are applied in the treatment of P. >> 98-108
DDI-MedLine.d204.s6 >> aeruginosa infections.
DDI-MedLine.d204.s7 >> Results revealed that the strains were resistant to many drugs at high levels, only piperacillin, carbenicillin, amikacin and ciprofloxacin showed resistances at comparatively lower levels. >> 84-95,98-110,113-120,126-138
DDI-MedLine.d204.s8 >> Following multiple experimentations it was observed that methylglyoxal was also antimicrobic against all the strains at comparable levels. >> 57-69
DDI-MedLine.d204.s9 >> Distinct and statistically significant synergism was observed between methylglyoxal and piperacillin by disc diffusion tests when compared with their individual effects. >> 70-82,88-99
DDI-MedLine.d204.s10 >> The fractional inhibitory concentration index of this combination evaluated by checkerboard analysis, was 0.5, which confirmed synergism between the pair.
DDI-MedLine.d204.s11 >> Synergism was also noted when methylglyoxal was combined with carbenicillin and amikacin. >> 30-42,62-74,80-87
