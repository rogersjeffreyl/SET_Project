DDI-DrugBank.d761.s0 >> Alcohol: In a multiple-dose study in 30 normal weight subjects, coadministration of XENICAL and 40 grams of alcohol (e.g., approximately 3 glasses of wine) did not result in alteration of alcohol pharmacokinetics, orlistat pharmacodynamics (fecal fat excretion), or systemic exposure to orlistat. >> 0-6,84-90,108-114,188-194,214-221,287-294
DDI-DrugBank.d761.s1 >> Cyclosporine: Preliminary data from a XENICAL and cyclosporine drug interaction study indicate a reduction in cyclosporine plasma levels when XENICAL was coadministered with cyclosporine. >> 0-11,38-44,50-61,110-121,142-148,174-185
DDI-DrugBank.d761.s2 >> Digoxin: In 12 normal-weight subjects receiving XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 6 days, XENICAL did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of digoxin. >> 0-6,48-54,93-99,156-162
DDI-DrugBank.d761.s3 >> Fat-soluble Vitamin Supplements and Analogues: A pharmacokinetic interaction study showed a 30% reduction in beta-carotene supplement absorption when concomitantly administered with XENICAL. >> 0-30,109-121,182-188
DDI-DrugBank.d761.s4 >> XENICAL inhibited absorption of a vitamin E acetate supplement by approximately 60%. >> 0-6,34-50
DDI-DrugBank.d761.s5 >> The effect of orlistat on the absorption of supplemental vitamin D, vitamin A, and nutritionally-derived vitamin K is not known at this time. >> 14-21,57-65,68-76,105-113
DDI-DrugBank.d761.s6 >> Glyburide: In 12 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 80 mg three times a day for 5 days, orlistat did not alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics (blood glucose-lowering) of glyburide. >> 0-8,50-57,95-102,187-195
DDI-DrugBank.d761.s7 >> Nifedipine (extended-release tablets): In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 6 days, XENICAL did not alter the bioavailability of nifedipine (extended-release tablets). >> 0-9,78-84,123-129,168-177
DDI-DrugBank.d761.s8 >> Oral Contraceptives: In 20 normal-weight female subjects, the treatment of XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 23 days resulted in no changes in the ovulation-suppressing action of oral contraceptives. >> 5-18,75-81,187-200
DDI-DrugBank.d761.s9 >> Phenytoin: In 12 normal-weight subjects receiving XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 7 days, XENICAL did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single 300-mg dose of phenytoin. >> 0-8,50-56,95-101,165-173
DDI-DrugBank.d761.s10 >> Pravastatin: In a 2-way crossover study of 24 normal-weight, mildly hypercholesterolemic patients receiving XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 6 days, XENICAL did not affect the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin. >> 0-10,108-114,153-159,200-210
DDI-DrugBank.d761.s11 >> Warfarin: In 12 normal-weight subjects, administration of XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 16 days did not result in any change in either warfarin pharmacokinetics (both R- and S-enantiomers) or pharmacodynamics (prothrombin time and serum Factor VII). >> 0-7,58-64,142-149
DDI-DrugBank.d761.s12 >> Although undercarboxylated osteocalcin, a marker of vitamin K nutritional status, was unaltered with XENICAL administration, vitamin K levels tended to decline in subjects taking XENICAL. >> 101-107,179-185
DDI-DrugBank.d761.s13 >> Therefore, as vitamin K absorption may be decreased with XENICAL, patients on chronic stable doses of warfarin who are prescribed XENICAL should be monitored closely for changes in coagulation parameters. >> 14-22,57-63,102-109,130-136
