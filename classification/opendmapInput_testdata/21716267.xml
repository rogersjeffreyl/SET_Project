DDI-MedLine.d216.s0 >> Exposure to oral S-ketamine is unaffected by itraconazole but greatly increased by ticlopidine. >> 17-26,45-56,83-93
DDI-MedLine.d216.s1 >> This study examined drug-drug interactions of oral S-ketamine with the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine and the CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole. >> 51-60,107-117,143-154
DDI-MedLine.d216.s2 >> In this randomized, blinded, crossover study, 11 healthy volunteers ingested 0.2 mg/kg S-ketamine after pretreatments with oral ticlopidine (250 mg twice daily), itraconazole (200 mg once daily), or placebo in 6-day treatment periods at intervals of 4 weeks. >> 87-96,128-138,162-173
DDI-MedLine.d216.s3 >> Ticlopidine treatment increased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-   )) of oral ketamine by 2.4-fold, whereas itraconazole treatment did not increase the exposure to S-ketamine. >> 0-10,134-141,164-175,220-229
DDI-MedLine.d216.s4 >> The ratio of norketamine AUC(0-   ) to ketamine AUC(0-   ) was significantly decreased in the ticlopidine (P &lt; 0.001) and itraconazole phases (P = 0.006) as compared to placebo. >> 13-23,39-46,94-104,125-136
DDI-MedLine.d216.s5 >> In the ticlopidine and itraconazole phases, the areas under the effect-time curves (self-reported drowsiness and performance) were significantly higher than those in the placebo phase (P < 0.05). >> 7-17,23-34
DDI-MedLine.d216.s6 >> The findings suggest that the dosage of S-ketamine should be reduced in patients receiving ticlopidine. >> 40-49,91-101
