DDI-MedLine.d154.s0 >> Enhancement of humoral immune responses to inactivated Newcastle disease and avian influenza vaccines by oral administration of ginseng stem-and-leaf saponins in chickens. >> 77-100,128-157
DDI-MedLine.d154.s1 >> Newcastle disease (ND) and avian influenza (AI) are common in the poultry industry.
DDI-MedLine.d154.s2 >> The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral administration of ginseng stem-and-leaf saponins (GSLS) on the humoral immune responses of chickens to inactivated ND and AI vaccines. >> 81-110,113-116,166-179;188-195,166-176;185-186;188-195
DDI-MedLine.d154.s3 >> In experiment 1, oral administration of GSLS at a dose of 5 mg/kg of BW for 7 d on the immune response in chickens intramuscularly injected with inactivated ND vaccine was evaluated. >> 40-43,145-166
DDI-MedLine.d154.s4 >> Results showed that GSLS significantly increased the antibody level against ND in the serum of chickens. >> 20-23
DDI-MedLine.d154.s5 >> In experiment 2, the same regimen of GSLS was administered to chickens inoculated with inactivated AI vaccines, and an enhanced serum antibody response to AI vaccination was also observed. >> 37-40,87-109
DDI-MedLine.d154.s6 >> Considering the safety of GSLS, because no adverse effect was found throughout the experiments, GSLS may be a promising oral adjuvant to improve immunization in poultry. >> 26-29,96-99
