DDI-DrugBank.d652.s0 >> The effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal motility are antagonized by anticholinergic drugs and narcotic analgesics. >> 15-28,78-98,104-122
DDI-DrugBank.d652.s1 >> Additive sedative effects can occur when metoclopramide is given with alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics, or tranquilizers. >> 41-54,70-76,79-87,90-98,101-109,115-127
DDI-DrugBank.d652.s2 >> The finding that metoclopramide releases catecholamines in patients with essential hypertension suggests that it should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients receiving monoamine oxi-dase inhibitors. >> 17-30,173-201
DDI-DrugBank.d652.s3 >> Absorption of drugs from the stomach may be diminished (e.g., digoxin) by metoclopramide, whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drugs from the small bowel may be increased (e.g., acetaminophen, tetracycline, levodopa, ethanol, cyclosporine). >> 62-68,74-87,189-201,204-215,218-225,228-234,237-248
DDI-DrugBank.d652.s4 >> Gastroparesis (gastric stasis) may be responsible for poor diabetic control in some patients.
DDI-DrugBank.d652.s5 >> Exogenously administered insulin may begin to act before food has left the stomach and lead to hypoglycemia. >> 25-31
DDI-DrugBank.d652.s6 >> Because the action of metoclopramide will influence the delivery of food to the intestines and thus the rate of absorption, insulin dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment. >> 22-35,124-130
