DDI-MedLine.d201.s0 >> Antitumor effects of CRM197, a specific inhibitor of HB-EGF, in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. >> 21-26
DDI-MedLine.d201.s1 >> The therapeutic outcome for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) remains poor;
DDI-MedLine.d201.s2 >> thus, novel, targeted therapies are urgently needed.
DDI-MedLine.d201.s3 >> Recently, we showed that heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a member of the EGF family, is a promising target for the treatment of various types of cancer.
DDI-MedLine.d201.s4 >> The aim of the present study was to investigate whether HB-EGF is a therapeutic target for T-ALL, and to further elucidate the antitumor effects of a specific inhibitor of HB-EGF, cross-reacting material 197 (CRM197). >> 180-206,209-214
DDI-MedLine.d201.s5 >> We elucidated the expression of HB-EGF in T-ALL cell lines, and evaluated the effect of CRM197 on these cells alone or in combination with anticancer agent. >> 88-93,139-154
DDI-MedLine.d201.s6 >> The expression of EGFR and EGFR ligands was determined by flow cytometry, RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR.
DDI-MedLine.d201.s7 >> Induction of apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay.
DDI-MedLine.d201.s8 >> HB-EGF was strongly expressed by T-ALL cell lines, and the expression of both HB-EGF and EGFR was enhanced by doxorubicin. >> 110-120
DDI-MedLine.d201.s9 >> CRM197 induced apoptosis, and furthermore, the combination of CRM197 plus doxorubicin enhanced cytotoxicity in a T-ALL cell line. >> 0-5,62-67,74-84
DDI-MedLine.d201.s10 >> These results suggest that HB-EGF is a promising therapeutic target for T-ALL.
