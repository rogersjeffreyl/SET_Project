DDI-DrugBank.d780.s0 >> Anticholinesterases: Concurrent use of procaine hydrochloride and anticholinesterase agents may result in increased systemic toxicity since anticholinesterases inhibit the breakdown of procaine hydrochloride. >> 0-18,39-60,66-90,140-158,185-206
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s1 >> Antimyasthenics Concurrent use of procaine hydrochloride and antimyasthenics may result in loss of control of symptoms of myasthenia gravis due to antagonism of the effects of antimyasthenics on skeletal muscle. >> 34-55
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s2 >> Temporary dosage adjustment of antimyasthenics may be required.
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s3 >> Also antimyasthenics may have anticholinesterase activity.
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s4 >> CNS depressant medications: Concurrent use of procaine hydrochloride and CNS depressant medications may result in additive depressant effects. >> 0-13,46-67,73-98
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s5 >> Hyaluronidase: Hyaluronidase may increase the diffusion rate of procaine hydrochloride, resulting in a decreased time of onset, but an increase in systemic toxicity. >> 0-12,15-27,64-85
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s6 >> Neuromuscular blocking agents (such as suxamethonium chloride): Concurrent use of procaine hydrochloride and neuromuscular blocking agents may result in prolongation or enhancement of the neuromuscular blockade. >> 0-28,39-60,82-103,109-137
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s7 >> Sulfonamides: Concurrent use of procaine hydrochloride and sulfonamides may result in a reduction of the antibacterial action of the sulfonamide. >> 0-11,32-53,59-70,133-143
DDI-DrugBank.d780.s8 >> Acetazolamide: Concurrent use of acetazolamide and procaine hydrochloride may extend the plasma half-life of procaine. >> 0-12,33-45,51-72,109-116
