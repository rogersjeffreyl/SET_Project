DDI-MedLine.d189.s0 >> Effects of CYP inhibitors on precocene I metabolism and toxicity in rat liver slices. >> 29-39
DDI-MedLine.d189.s1 >> We present a comprehensive in vitro approach to assessing metabolism-mediated hepatotoxicity using male Sprague-Dawley rat liver slices incubated with the well characterized hepatotoxicant, precocene I, and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. >> 190-200
DDI-MedLine.d189.s2 >> This approach combines liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC MS) detection methods with multiple toxicity endpoints to enable identification of critical metabolic pathways for hepatotoxicity.
DDI-MedLine.d189.s3 >> The incubations were performed in the absence and presence of the non-specific CYP inhibitor, 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT) and isoform-specific inhibitors. >> 94-113,116-118
DDI-MedLine.d189.s4 >> The metabolite profile of precocene I in rat liver slices shares some features of the in vivo profile, but also had a major difference in that epoxide dihydrodiol hydrolysis products were not observed to a measurable extent. >> 26-36
DDI-MedLine.d189.s5 >> As examples of our liver slice metabolite identification procedure, a minor glutathione adduct and previously unreported 7-O-desmethyl and glucuronidated metabolites of precocene I are reported. >> 169-179
DDI-MedLine.d189.s6 >> Precocene I induced hepatocellular necrosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. >> 0-10
DDI-MedLine.d189.s7 >> ABT decreased the toxicity of precocene I, increased exposure to parent compound, and decreased metabolite levels in a dose-dependent manner. >> 0-2,30-40
DDI-MedLine.d189.s8 >> Of the isoform-specific CYP inhibitors tested for an effect on the precocene I metabolite profile, only tranylcypromine was noticeably effective, indicating a role of CYPs 2A6, 2C9, 2Cl9, and 2E1. >> 67-77,104-118
DDI-MedLine.d189.s9 >> With respect to toxicity, the order of CYP inhibitor effectiveness was ABT>diethyldithiocarbamate~tranylcypromine>ketoconazole. >> 71-73,75-96,98-112,114-125
DDI-MedLine.d189.s10 >> Furafylline and sulfaphenazole had no effect, while quinidine appeared to augment precocene I toxicity. >> 0-10,16-29,52-60,82-92
DDI-MedLine.d189.s11 >> These results suggest that rat liver slices do not reproduce the reported in vivo biotransformation of precocene I and therefore may not be an appropriate model for precocene I metabolism. >> 103-113,165-175
DDI-MedLine.d189.s12 >> However, these results provide an example of how small molecule manipulation of CYP activity in an in vitro model can be used to confirm metabolism-mediated toxicity.
