DDI-DrugBank.d599.s0 >> Excessive glucocorticoid therapy will inhibit the growth-promoting effect of human GH. >> 77-84
DDI-DrugBank.d599.s1 >> Patients with ACTH deficiency should have their glucocorticoid-replacement dose carefully adjusted to avoid an inhibitory effect on growth. >> 48-61
DDI-DrugBank.d599.s2 >> The use of Nutropin in patients with chronic renal insufficiency receiving glucocorticoid therapy has not been evaluated. >> 11-18
DDI-DrugBank.d599.s3 >> Concomitant glucocorticoid therapy may inhibit the growth-promoting effect of Nutropin. >> 78-85
DDI-DrugBank.d599.s4 >> If glucocorticoid replacement is required, the glucocorticoid dose should be carefully adjusted. >> 3-16,47-60
DDI-DrugBank.d599.s5 >> There was no evidence in the controlled studies of Nutropin   s interaction with drugs commonly used in chronic renal insufficiency patients. >> 51-58
DDI-DrugBank.d599.s6 >> Limited published data indicate that GH treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CP450) mediated antipyrine clearance in man. >> 37-38,93-102
DDI-DrugBank.d599.s7 >> These data suggest that GH administration may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporin). >> 24-25,133-147,150-161,164-178,181-191
DDI-DrugBank.d599.s8 >> Careful monitoring is advisable when GH is administered in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes. >> 37-38
