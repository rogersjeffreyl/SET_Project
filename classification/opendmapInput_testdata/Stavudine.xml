DDI-DrugBank.d727.s0 >> Zidovudine competitively inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of stavudine. >> 0-9,71-79
DDI-DrugBank.d727.s1 >> Therefore, use of zidovudine in combination with ZERIT should be avoided. >> 18-27,49-53
DDI-DrugBank.d727.s2 >> In vitro data indicate that the phosphorylation of stavudine is also inhibited at relevant concentrations by doxorubicin and ribavirin. >> 51-59,109-119,125-133
DDI-DrugBank.d727.s3 >> The clinical significance of these in vitro interactions is unknown;
DDI-DrugBank.d727.s4 >> therefore, concomitant use of stavudine with either of these drugs should be undertaken with caution. >> 30-38
