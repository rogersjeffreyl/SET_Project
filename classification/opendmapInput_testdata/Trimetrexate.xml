DDI-DrugBank.d766.s0 >> Since trimetrexate is metabolized by a P450 enzyme system, drugs that induce or inhibit this drug metabolizing enzyme system may elicit important drug-drug interactions that may alter trimetrexate plasma concentrations. >> 6-17,184-195
DDI-DrugBank.d766.s1 >> Agents that might be coadministered with trimetrexate in AIDS patients for other indications that could elicit this activity include erythromycin, rifampin, rifabutin, ketoconazole, and fluconazole. >> 41-52,133-144,147-154,157-165,168-179,186-196
DDI-DrugBank.d766.s2 >> In vitro perfusion of isolated rat liver has shown that cimetidine caused a significant reduction in trimetrexate metabolism and that acetaminophen altered the relative concentration of trimetrexate metabolites possibly by competing for sulfate metabolites. >> 56-65,101-112,134-146
DDI-DrugBank.d766.s3 >> Based on an in vitro rat liver model, nitrogen substituted imidazole drugs (clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole) were potent, non-competitive inhibitors of trimetrexate metabolism. >> 59-73,76-87,90-101,104-113,159-170
DDI-DrugBank.d766.s4 >> Patients medicated with these drugs and trimetrexate should be carefully monitored. >> 40-51
