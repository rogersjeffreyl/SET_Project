DDI-DrugBank.d752.s0 >> Drug Interactions: Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Isozymes: Caution is advised when midazolam is administered concomitantly with drugs that are known to inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system (ie, some drugs in the drug classes of azole antimycotics, protease inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, and macrolide antibiotics). >> 74-82,228-245,248-266,269-295,302-322
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s1 >> Drugs such as erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, ketoconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole were shown to significantly increase the C max and AUC of orally administered midazolam. >> 14-25,28-36,39-47,50-61,64-74,80-91,171-179
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s2 >> These drug interactions may result in increased and prolonged sedation due to a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam. >> 112-120
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s3 >> Although not studied, the potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors ritonavir and nelfinavir may cause intense and prolonged sedation and respiratory depression due to a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam. >> 64-72,78-87,198-206
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s4 >> Caution is advised when VERSED Syrup is used concomitantly with these drugs. >> 24-35
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s5 >> Dose adjustments should be considered and possible prolongation and intensity of effect should be anticipated.
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s6 >> Inducers of CYP3A4 Isozymes: Cytochrome P450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, induce metabolism and caused a markedly decreased C max and AUC of oral midazolam in adult studies. >> 63-70,73-85,92-100,175-183
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s7 >> Although clinical studies have not been performed, phenobarbital is expected to have the same effect. >> 51-63
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s8 >> Caution is advised when administering VERSED Syrup to patients receiving these medications and if necessary dose adjustments should be considered. >> 38-49
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s9 >> The difficulty in achieving adequate sedation may have been the result of decreased absorption of the sedatives due to both the gastrointestinal effects and stimulant effects of methylphenidate. >> 102-110,178-192
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s10 >> The sedative effect of VERSED Syrup is accentuated by any concomitantly administered medication which depresses the central nervous system, particularly narcotics (eg, morphine, meperidine and fentanyl), propofol, ketamine, nitrous oxide, secobarbital and droperidol. >> 23-34,153-161,168-175,178-187,193-200,204-211,214-221,224-236,239-250,256-265
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s11 >> Consequently, the dose of VERSED Syrup should be adjusted according to the type and amount of concomitant medications administered and the desired clinical response. >> 26-37
DDI-DrugBank.d752.s12 >> No significant adverse interactions with common premedications (such as atropine, scopolamine, glycopyrrolate, diazepam, hydroxyzine, and other muscle relaxants) or local anesthetics have been observed. >> 72-79,82-92,95-108,111-118,121-131,144-159,171-181
