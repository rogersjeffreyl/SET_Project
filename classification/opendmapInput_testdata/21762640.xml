DDI-MedLine.d166.s0 >> Improved parathyroid hormone control by cinacalcet is associated with reduction in darbepoetin requirement in patients with end-stage renal disease. >> 40-49,83-93
DDI-MedLine.d166.s1 >> Uncontrolled hy-per-parathyroidism causes bone marrow fibrosis, leading to erythropoietin (EPO) resistance. >> 75-88,91-93
DDI-MedLine.d166.s2 >> Medical treatment with cinacalcet is effective in reducing plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, but its effect on darbepoetin dosing is unknown. >> 23-32,118-128
DDI-MedLine.d166.s3 >> METHODS AND AIMS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 40 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients (age: 55    14; mean    SD; 21:male) who had at least 12 months of cinacalcet therapy. >> 173-182
DDI-MedLine.d166.s4 >> The distribution of renal replacement therapies were: 14 peritoneal dialysis, 18 conventional hemodialysis and 8 nocturnal hemodialysis.
DDI-MedLine.d166.s5 >> Standard dialysis related biochemical indices and medications used were recorded.
DDI-MedLine.d166.s6 >> The primary objective of the study was to ascertain the difference in darbepoetin responsiveness before and after 12 months of cinacalcet therapy. >> 70-80,127-136
DDI-MedLine.d166.s7 >> Our secondary objective was to determine if there was a relationship between the changes in PTH and darbepoetin requirement. >> 100-110
DDI-MedLine.d166.s8 >> Overall, PTH levels decreased from 197.5 (151.8; 249.2) to 66.1 (41.2; 136.5) (median (25th;75th percentile)) pmol/l;
DDI-MedLine.d166.s9 >> p &lt;
DDI-MedLine.d166.s10 >> 0.001.
DDI-MedLine.d166.s11 >> Cinacalcet dose increased from 30.0   6 to 63   25 mg/day, p < >> 0-9
DDI-MedLine.d166.s12 >> 0.05.
DDI-MedLine.d166.s13 >> Hemoglobin remained unchanged (116   13 to 116   13 g/l), while darbepoetin requirement decreased from 40 (20; 60) to 24 (19; 59)   g/week, p = 0.02. >> 64-74
DDI-MedLine.d166.s14 >> The remainder of the dialysis-related biochemistry (electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, iron status) and vitamin D use remained unchanged.
DDI-MedLine.d166.s15 >> A reduction in PTH level of greater than 30% was experienced by 82.5% (33/40) of our cohort.
DDI-MedLine.d166.s16 >> Among the responders, the fall in PTH and reduction darbepoetin requirement were related (R = -0.48, p = 0.004). >> 52-62
DDI-MedLine.d166.s17 >> Reduction of PTH by cinacalcet is associated with a decrease in darbepoetin requirement. >> 20-29,64-74
DDI-MedLine.d166.s18 >> The interface between bone and bone marrow in uremia represents a critical step in red blood cell production which merits further investigation.
