DDI-MedLine.d164.s1 >> Although it was previously reported that lapatinib combined with Herceptin improved the progression-free survival rate compared with lapatinib alone for patients with Herceptin-refractory HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, the mechanism is purported to be an antiproliferative effect relating to the synergism of these two agents. >> 41-49,65-73,133-141,167-175
DDI-MedLine.d164.s2 >> We evaluated how lapatinib interacts with Herceptin in HER2-positive breast cancer, with a particular focus on Herceptin-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). >> 17-25,42-50,111-119
DDI-MedLine.d164.s3 >> In an in vitro assay, lapatinib induced HER2 expression at the cell surface of HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines, leading to the enhancement of Herceptin-mediated ADCC. >> 22-30,149-157
DDI-MedLine.d164.s4 >> Furthermore, we present a case report in which a second Herceptin treatment following lapatinib resulted in the marked shrinkage of multiple metastatic tumors in HER2-positive breast cancer. >> 56-64,86-94
DDI-MedLine.d164.s5 >> Lapatinib may have the potential to convert Herceptin-refractory to Herceptin-sensitive tumors in HER2-positive breast cancer by up-regulation of the cell surface expression of HER2. >> 0-8,44-52,68-76
