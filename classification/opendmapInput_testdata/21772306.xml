DDI-MedLine.d163.s0 >> In vitro activity of minocycline combined with fosfomycin against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. >> 21-31,47-56,87-97
DDI-MedLine.d163.s1 >> This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro activity of minocycline combined with fosfomycin against isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). >> 54-64,80-89,111-121
DDI-MedLine.d163.s2 >> A total of 87 clinical isolates of MRSA collected from three Chinese hospitals were included in the study.
DDI-MedLine.d163.s3 >> The checkerboard method with determination of the fractional IC index (FICI) was used to determine whether antibiotic combinations act synergistically against these isolates. >> 107-116
DDI-MedLine.d163.s4 >> The susceptibility results for minocycline and fosfomycin were interpreted according to the most relevant criteria. >> 31-41,47-56
DDI-MedLine.d163.s5 >> The results demonstrated the following interactions: 76 isolates (87.4%) showed synergistic interactions (FICI   0.5) and 11 isolates (12.6%) showed indifferent interactions (0.5&lt;FICI&lt;4).
DDI-MedLine.d163.s6 >> No antagonistic interactions (FICI   4) were observed.
DDI-MedLine.d163.s7 >> The combination of minocycline and fosfomycin can be synergistic against MRSA. >> 19-29,35-44
DDI-MedLine.d163.s8 >> Further studies are required to determine the potential clinical role of this combination regimen as a therapeutic alternative for certain types of MRSA infections.
