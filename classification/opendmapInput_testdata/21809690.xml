DDI-MedLine.d214.s5 >> Acute administration of hemantane or doxycycline failed to influence locomotion in mice, while their combination normalized motor activity. >> 24-32,37-47
DDI-MedLine.d214.s6 >> The results obtained confirm the role of inflammatory processes in parkinsonism and suggest expediency of combined pharmacotherapy of neurodegenerative diseases.
