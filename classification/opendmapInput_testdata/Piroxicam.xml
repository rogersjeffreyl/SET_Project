DDI-DrugBank.d656.s0 >> FELDENE is highly protein bound, and therefore, might be expected to displace other protein-bound drugs. >> 0-6
DDI-DrugBank.d656.s1 >> Although this has not occurred in in vitro studies with coumarin-type anticoagulants, interactions with coumarin-type anticoagulants have been reported with FELDENE since marketing, therefore, physicians should closely monitor patients for a change in dosage requirements when administering FELDENE to patients on coumarin-type anticoagulants and other highly protein-bound drugs. >> 56-83,104-131,157-163,291-297,314-341
DDI-DrugBank.d656.s2 >> Plasma levels of piroxicam are depressed to approximately 80% of their normal values when FELDENE is administered in conjunction with aspirin (3900 mg/day), but concomitant administration of antacids has no effect on piroxicam plasma levels . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including FELDENE, have been reported to increase steady state plasma lithium levels. >> 17-25,90-96,134-140,191-198,217-225,243-279,292-298,352-358
DDI-DrugBank.d656.s3 >> It is recommended that plasma lithium levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing FELDENE. >> 30-36,103-109
