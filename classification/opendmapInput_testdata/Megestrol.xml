DDI-DrugBank.d688.s0 >> Pharmacokinetic studies show that there are no significant alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters of zidovudine or rifabutin to warrant dosage adjustment when megestrol acetate is administered with these drugs. >> 104-113,118-126,162-178
DDI-DrugBank.d688.s1 >> A pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that coadministration of megestrol acetate and indinavir results in a significant decrease in the pharmacokinetic parameters (~36% for Cmax and ~28% for AUC) of indinavir. >> 62-78,84-92,198-206
DDI-DrugBank.d688.s2 >> Administration of a higher dose of indinavir should be considered when coadministering with megestrol acetate. >> 35-43,92-108
DDI-DrugBank.d688.s3 >> The effects of indinavir, zidovudine or rifabutin on the pharmacokinetics of megestrol acetate were not studied. >> 15-23,26-35,40-48,77-93
