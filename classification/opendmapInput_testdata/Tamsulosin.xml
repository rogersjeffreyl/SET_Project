DDI-DrugBank.d704.s0 >> Drug-Drug Interactions: The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between FLOMAX capsules and other alpha-adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined. >> 85-90,111-142
DDI-DrugBank.d704.s1 >> However, interactions may be expected and FLOMAX capsules should NOT be used in combination with other alpha-adrenergic blocking agents. >> 42-47,103-134
DDI-DrugBank.d704.s2 >> The pharmacokinetic interaction between cimetidine and FLOMAX capsules was investigated. >> 40-49,55-60
DDI-DrugBank.d704.s3 >> The results indicate significant changes in tamsulosin HCI clearance (26% decrease) and AUC (44% increase). >> 44-57
DDI-DrugBank.d704.s4 >> Therefore, FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at doses higher than 0.4 mg. >> 11-16,75-84
DDI-DrugBank.d704.s5 >> Results from limited in vitro and in vivo drug-drug interaction studies between tamsulosin HCI and warfarin are inconclusive. >> 80-93,99-106
DDI-DrugBank.d704.s6 >> Therefore, caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and FLOMAX capsules. >> 74-81,87-92
