DDI-MedLine.d143.s0 >> [Interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors]. >> 21-31,37-58
DDI-MedLine.d143.s1 >> The drug interaction between proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel has been the subject of much study in recent years. >> 29-50,56-66
DDI-MedLine.d143.s2 >> Contradictory results regarding the effect of proton pump inhibitors on platelet reactivity and on clinical outcome in clopidogrel-treated patients have been reported in literature. >> 46-67,119-129
DDI-MedLine.d143.s3 >> Concomitant use of omeprazole and clopidogrel was found to decrease the exposure (AUC) to clopidogrel's active metabolite by 50% and to sharply increase platelet reactivity, as a result of inhibition by omeprazole of CYP2C19, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme. >> 19-28,34-44,203-212
DDI-MedLine.d143.s4 >> Pantoprazole has a much weaker effect on clopidogrel's pharmacokinetics and on platelet reactivity during concomitant use. >> 0-11,41-51
DDI-MedLine.d143.s5 >> The influence of the other proton pump inhibitors when used simultaneously with clopidogrel has not yet been investigated in adequately randomized studies. >> 27-48,80-90
DDI-MedLine.d143.s6 >> Regulatory agencies state that the combination of clopidogrel and the CYP2C19 inhibitors omeprazole and esomeprazole should be avoided. >> 50-60,89-98,104-115
DDI-MedLine.d143.s7 >> To date, there is no conclusive evidence of a clinically-relevant interaction between any of the proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel. >> 97-118,124-134
