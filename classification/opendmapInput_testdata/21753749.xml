DDI-MedLine.d213.s0 >> In vivo CYP3A activity is significantly lower in cyclosporine-treated as compared with tacrolimus-treated renal allograft recipients. >> 49-60,87-96
DDI-MedLine.d213.s1 >> In vitro studies have identified cyclosporine and tacrolimus as CYP3A inhibitors. >> 33-44,50-59
DDI-MedLine.d213.s2 >> In the current study in renal allograft recipients, we used intravenously and orally administered midazolam as a drug probe to assess whether the study drugs at doses that are generally used in clinical practice have differential effects on in vivo hepatic and first-pass CYP3A activities. >> 98-106
DDI-MedLine.d213.s3 >> Systemic and apparent oral midazolam clearance were 24% (269    73 vs. 354    102  ml/min, P = 0.022) and 31% (479    190 vs. 688    265  ml/min, P = 0.013), respectively, lower in cyclosporine-treated patients (n = 20) than in matched tacrolimus-treated patients (n = 20). >> 27-35,181-192,236-245
DDI-MedLine.d213.s4 >> The latter displayed midazolam clearances similar to those in two larger cohorts of nonmatched tacrolimus-treated patients (n = 58 and n = 80) and to those receiving a calcineurin inhibitor-free regimen (n = 6). >> 21-29,95-104,168-188
DDI-MedLine.d213.s5 >> This implies that in vivo hepatic and first-pass CYP3A activities are significantly lower in patients receiving cyclosporine than in those receiving tacrolimus, indicating that, at the doses generally used in clinical practice, cyclosporine is the stronger of the two with respect to CYP3A inhibition. >> 112-123,149-158,228-239
DDI-MedLine.d213.s6 >> This observation has important implications in the context of drug-drug interactions in transplant recipients.
