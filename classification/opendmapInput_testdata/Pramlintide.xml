DDI-DrugBank.d632.s0 >> Due to its effects on gastric emptying, SYMLIN therapy should not be considered for patients taking drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility (e.g., anticholinergic agents such as atropine) and agents that slow the intestinal absorption of nutrients (e.g., alpha glucosidase inhibitors). >> 40-45,150-171,181-188,258-285
DDI-DrugBank.d632.s1 >> Patients using these drugs have not been studied in clinical trials.
DDI-DrugBank.d632.s2 >> SYMLIN has the potential to delay the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. >> 0-5
DDI-DrugBank.d632.s3 >> When the rapid onset of a concomitant orally administered agent is a critical determinant of effectiveness (such as analgesics), the agent should be administered at least 1 hour prior to or 2 hours after SYMLIN injection. >> 116-125,204-209
DDI-DrugBank.d632.s4 >> In clinical trials, the concomitant use of sulfonylureas or biguanides did not alter the adverse event profile of SYMLIN. >> 43-55,60-69,114-119
DDI-DrugBank.d632.s5 >> No formal interaction studies have been performed to assess the effect of SYMLIN on the kinetics of oral antidiabetic agents. >> 74-79,105-123
DDI-DrugBank.d632.s6 >> Mixing SYMLIN and Insulin The pharmacokinetic parameters of SYMLIN were altered when mixed with regular, NPH, and 70/30 premixed formulations of recombinant human insulin immediately prior to injection. >> 7-12,18-24,60-65,157-169
DDI-DrugBank.d632.s7 >> Thus, SYMLIN and insulin should not be mixed and must be administered separately. >> 6-11,17-23
